# This is an interaction prototype for a fall safety training program

## Locomotion:
The locomotion system includes smooth movement and snap turn with the
<br>
possibility of the ability to switch to teleportation if time permits

## Interactions Include:
<details>
<summary>A cube that can be grabbed and scaled with two hands</summary>

- May be used in a "spot the safety risk" section where the user has to manipulate the scene and look for potential risks
- Also wanted to figure out how to make it work out of curiosity
- Cube changes colour when moved more than 0.5m from where it spawned
</details>

<details>
<summary>A stationary dial that controls the volume of a sound</summary>

- Dial interaction could be used to change the height of the roof so the user can experience different heights (scary)
</details>

<details>
<summary>A UI button that plays a sound</summary>

- This could be used in combination with text UI to provide instructions with a sound queue
</details>

<details>
<summary>A UI timer that tracks how long it has been since you entered play mode</summary>

- Could provide statistics on how long it took a user to complete the experience
